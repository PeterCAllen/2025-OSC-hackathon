# 2024 Oz Single Cell Hackathon

{% include figure.html img="hackathon_ad.jpeg" alt="Hackathon Flyer" width="75%" %}

Welcome to the 2024 edition of Oz Single Cell Hackathon!

This year's hackathon will be hosted in Sydney from 9th-10th December.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

About the event:

The OzSingleCell Hackathon is an event that brings together experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) scientists working in various disciplines, tackling a new outstanding question in the field of biology. UX/UI engineers, AI/ML, deep learning, graph neural networks, computer vision or image preprocessing and others working on disparate genomics fields are also encouraged to attend.

The event offers early-career researchers and leaders in single-cell genomics the opportunity to foster new collaborations, connections and tools to build on Australia's capabilities in single-cell genomics. The intended outcomes for each workshop are:

Seeding of new projects and collaborations
New tools for single-cell data visualisation and/or analysis
Publication of a Grand Challenges summary
This yearâ€™s theme will be Temporal Dynamics: Defining Cellular Time. We will analyse a multi-day capture dataset of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, assayed using the Scale Biosciences Technology to identify dynamic molecular features associated with cell states transitioning. Data challenges may involve developing new methods for defining cell trajectories, quantifying inter-sample variation in cell development or data visualisation.

If you are willing to collaborate with other talented individuals, showcase your skills and contribute to developing creative solutions to address real scientific challenges, you just need to reserve your spot for this event. We are excited to have you on board!


Hackathon: Monday 9th Dec 9am-late and Tuesday 10 Dec 9-5pm.

Sponsorship: We thank Oz Single Cell, Integrated Science and Scale Biosciences for their generous support including travel awards and catering.
