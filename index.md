About the event:

The OzSingleCell Hackathon is an event that brings together experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) scientists working in various disciplines, tackling a new outstanding question in the field of biology. UX/UI engineers, AI/ML, deep learning, graph neural networks, computer vision or image preprocessing and others working on disparate genomics fields are also encouraged to attend.

The event offers early-career researchers and leaders in single-cell genomics the opportunity to foster new collaborations, connections and tools to build on Australia's capabilities in single-cell genomics. The intended outcomes for each workshop are:

Seeding of new projects and collaborations
New tools for single-cell data visualisation and/or analysis
Publication of a Grand Challenges summary

**PLACEHOLDER FOR Theme BLURB**

If you are willing to collaborate with other talented individuals, showcase your skills and contribute to developing creative solutions to address real scientific challenges, you just need to reserve your spot for this event. We are excited to have you on board!


Hackathon: Monday 19th May 9am-late, Tuesday 20th May 9am-5pm, Wednesday 21st May 9am-12pm
