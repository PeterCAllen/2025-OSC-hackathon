* *Stem Cells:* A type of cell that has the unique potential to generate any other cell type in the human body. For this work we've used induced pluripotent stem cells which can be generated from adult human tissues like skin fibroblasts by exposing them to a cocktail of transcription factors.

* *Differentiation:* The process of a stem cell transitioning to a terminal cell type that is no longer capable of generating other cell types.

* *Cardiomyocytes:* Heart muscle cell cells that generates the heart contraction for pumping blood through the body.

* *Genotype:* Unique genetic profile of an individual.
