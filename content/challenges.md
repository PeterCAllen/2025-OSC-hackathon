To help you get the creative juices flowing, we've come up with a few challenges that you might decide to tackle. These fall into a the following categories:


## Benchmarking

- Establish a method to determine which pseudotime method works best for a given dataset
- Build methods to ascertain if biological cell states are reproducible across biological replicates


## Visualisation

- Develop more intuitive visualisation of temporal dynamics and transitions across states in single-cell datasets


## Biological Interpretation

- Construct tools to identify genes that characterise pseudotime
- Build methods to identify biologically-grounded pseudotime that accurately positions cells across dynamic cell states
- Establish platforms to ascertain the biological processes being defined by pseudotime estimations.



If you have a great idea outside of these prompts, that's great too!
