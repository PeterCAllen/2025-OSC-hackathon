To help you get the creative juices flowing, we've come up with a few challenges that you might decide to tackle.


1. Build methods to identify biologically-grounded pseudotime that accurately positions cells across dynamic cell states
2. Establish methods to ascertain if biological cell states are reproducible across biological replicates
3. Develop more intuitive visualisation of temporal dynamics and transitions across states in single-cell datasets
4. Construct tools to identify genes that characterise pseudotime


Establish a method to determine which pseudotime method works best for a given dataset.
Benchmark pseudotime methods

How to extract biological meaning from pseudotime estimations.


If you have a great idea outside of these challenges, that's great too - just make sure you find some hacking friends that want to help you solve it.
